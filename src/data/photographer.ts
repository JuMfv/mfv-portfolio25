  name: 'Julien Mfochive',
  tagline: 'Full-Stack Developer | Data Transition',
  heroIntroduction: 'Designing software architectures focused on performance and user experience.',
  biography: `Julien Mfochive is a solutions architect, with recognition for successful projects such as the 'Data Pipeline Innovation Award 2023' and the 'Scalable Architecture Prize 2022'. His work has been featured in technical case studies, collaborating with leading companies such as Ubisoft game studios, research institutes, and high-growth platforms.

Based in Paris, my background includes an MBA in Risk Management and Data from HEC Business School and Digital Campus, offering a unique perspective for each project. I combine technical expertise with a strategic vision.`,
  approach: `My photography is guided by three principles: authenticity, composition, and light. I believe the best images emerge when subjects feel comfortable and genuine, when composition guides the viewer's eye naturally, and when light reveals the essence of the moment.

Whether working on editorial assignments or commercial projects, I strive to create images that transcend their immediate purpose and become lasting visual statements.`,
